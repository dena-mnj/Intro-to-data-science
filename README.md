# Intro-to-data-science

I took this course on Coursera platform. This course introduced the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. 
I learned: 
1) How to perform data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library.
2) Introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis
3) Tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively.

In a nutshell, I leanred how to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. 

In this repository I showcased my assignments.
